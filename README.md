# Board Game

This is a simple, interactive board game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The game features a grid of squares. Each square, when hovered over, changes its color from a pre-defined list of colors. The color change comes with a subtle transition effect, creating a pleasing visual interaction.

## Files

The project consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the structure of the game board.

2. `styles.css`: The CSS file that handles the styling of the game board and its squares. This includes the hover transition effect.

3. `app.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the dynamic functionality of the game. It generates the game board, changes the color of squares when they are hovered over, and removes the color when the mouse pointer leaves the square.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game.
2. Move your mouse pointer over the squares to see them change color.
